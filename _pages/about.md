Hello! My name is Hanxiao “Lola” Ye, and I am currently completing my Master of Science in Marketing at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I maintain a 3.74/4.00 GPA . Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor of Finance from Renmin University of China (2020–2024) and spent an exchange year at Kedge Business School in France (2022–2023), gaining international perspective on business management and quantitative analytics .

Over the past two years, I have held several marketing and strategy internships in fast-paced environments. As a User Strategy Intern at Ximalaya Technology, I designed and executed surveys, conducted over 3,000 user interviews, and delivered actionable insights to reduce churn . At Yongzheng Asset Management, I streamlined weekly net-value reporting—boosting department efficiency by 50%—and supported new product launches through competitive analysis and sales training coordination . I also worked as a Digital Marketing Intern at Chicmax Group, where I co-produced a 12-episode educational video series that reached over 500,000 viewers and partnered with leading KOLs to achieve hundreds of thousands of engagements per episode . Earlier, I supported LVMH’s Louis Vuitton brand by evaluating luxury watch market trends and recommending targeted social-media campaigns, and I interned at Kaiyuan Securities researching real-estate markets and authoring detailed analytical reports .

In addition to hands-on experience, I have led a university-industry project formulating a post-pandemic tourism strategy for Marseille’s City Tourism Office and captained a team to 6th place nationally (among 8,600 entries) in the “ICBC Cup” FinTech Innovation Competition by designing an app for urban housing renovation . I am fluent in Mandarin and English (with basic Cantonese), and proficient in Microsoft Office, R, Python, and SQL . I am passionate about leveraging data-driven marketing to drive growth and engagement, and I look forward to bringing these skills to a dynamic marketing team.
